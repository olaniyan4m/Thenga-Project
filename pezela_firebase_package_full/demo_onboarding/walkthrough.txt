Pezela Pilot Onboarding Walkthrough - 5 Merchants (Use this to onboard pilot merchants quickly)

Goal: Get 5 pilot merchants live with WhatsApp ordering and payment links within 3 days.

Preparation:
1. Create Firebase project and set functions config (PayFast, Yoco keys, WhatsApp tokens).
2. Deploy Cloud Functions: `firebase deploy --only functions`
3. Configure WhatsApp Cloud API and set phone number ID and token.
4. Prepare demo product images and upload to Firebase Storage if needed.

Steps for each merchant (approx 30-45 minutes per merchant):
1. Register merchant via API or use Firebase console to create user (use demo phone/email).
   POST /auth/register { name, phone, businessName, email (optional), password }
2. Create 3 demo products via POST /merchants/{merchantId}/catalog
   - Example: Loaf of Bread, Small Cake, Bottle of Juice
3. Configure payment method: create a Yoco or PayFast payment link for each sample order
   - POST /payments/yoco/create-link or /payments/payfast/create with order details
   - Send link via WhatsApp to test customer and confirm payment
4. Configure WhatsApp templates (register templates with Meta if using Cloud API):
   - greeting, acknowledge_order, payment_confirm, daily_summary
5. Teach merchant how to accept orders:
   - Show how to open catalogue on WhatsApp, receive orders, send payment link
   - Demonstrate saving offline orders using PWA: open PWA, 'save order' button (use window.PezelaOffline.saveOfflineOrder)
   - Show how to sync orders when back online (window.PezelaOffline.syncOrders)
6. Provide quick hardware advice for load-shedding:
   - Recommend power bank capable of charging phone, and simple UPS for small POS (link suppliers)
7. Collect testimonial and permission to use feedback

Post-onboarding tasks:
- Monitor /admin/reconcile-payments results
- Verify webhook receipts in db collection 'webhookEvents'
- Reduce manual effort by templating product creation and WhatsApp messages.

Metrics to capture during pilot:
- Time to onboard (minutes)
- Number of orders received in first week
- % paid via digital link vs cash
- Merchant satisfaction score (1-5)
