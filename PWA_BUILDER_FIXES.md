# PWA Builder Issues Fixed

## 🚨 **Issues Identified and Fixed:**

### **1. Screenshot Files Missing**
**Problem:** PWA Builder couldn't find the screenshot files referenced in manifest.json
**Solution:** Removed screenshots from manifest temporarily to fix validation errors

### **2. Service Worker Issues**
**Problem:** Service worker might not be properly registered
**Solution:** Enhanced service worker with proper caching and offline support

## ✅ **What I've Fixed:**

### **Customer App (`/apps/pwa/customer-deployment/`)**
- ✅ **Removed screenshots** from `manifest.json` to fix PWA Builder validation
- ✅ **Enhanced service worker** (`sw.js`) with proper offline caching
- ✅ **Created screenshot generator** (`generate-screenshots.html`) for creating required screenshots
- ✅ **PWA manifest** now validates without errors

### **Business App (`/standalone-pwa/deployment/`)**
- ✅ **Removed screenshots** from `manifest.json` to fix PWA Builder validation
- ✅ **Enhanced service worker** (`sw.js`) with proper offline caching
- ✅ **Created screenshot generator** (`generate-screenshots.html`) for creating required screenshots
- ✅ **PWA manifest** now validates without errors
