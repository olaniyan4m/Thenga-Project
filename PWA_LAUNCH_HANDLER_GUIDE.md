# PWA Launch Handler & Link Handling Guide

## 🚀 **Enhanced PWA Manifest Features Added**

I've added advanced PWA features to both your Business and Customer app manifests to improve user experience and app behavior.

## ✅ **New Manifest Properties Added:**

### **1. Launch Handler**
```json
"launch_handler": {
  "client_mode": ["navigate-existing", "auto"]
}
```

**What it does:**
- **`navigate-existing`**: If the app is already open, it brings it into focus and navigates to the target URL
- **`auto`**: Fallback - the user agent makes the decision based on context

**Benefits:**
- **📱 Better UX**: No duplicate app instances
- **🔄 Smart Navigation**: Existing app instances are reused
- **⚡ Faster Launch**: No need to start new app instances

### **2. Handle Links**
```json
"handle_links": "preferred"
```

**What it does:**
- **`preferred`**: Opens in-scope links within the installed PWA application
- **Better than `auto`**: Explicitly tells the browser to use the PWA

**Benefits:**
- **📱 Native Feel**: Links open in the PWA instead of browser
- **🔄 Consistent Experience**: All navigation stays within the app
- **⚡ Faster Loading**: No browser context switching

## 📱 **How These Features Work:**

### **Launch Handler Behavior:**
1. **User clicks app icon** → App launches normally
2. **User clicks app icon again** → Existing app comes to focus (no duplicate)
3. **User clicks deep link** → Existing app navigates to that URL
4. **Fallback to `auto`** → Browser decides best behavior

### **Handle Links Behavior:**
1. **User clicks link in PWA** → Opens within the PWA
2. **User clicks external link** → Opens in PWA if in scope
3. **Better integration** → Seamless navigation experience

## 🎯 **PWA Benefits:**

### **For Users:**
- **📱 Native App Feel**: Behaves like a real mobile app
- **🔄 No Duplicates**: Smart app instance management
- **⚡ Faster Navigation**: Links open within the app
- **📱 Consistent Experience**: All navigation stays in PWA

### **For Business:**
- **📈 Higher Engagement**: Users stay within the app
- **🔄 Better Retention**: No browser context switching
- **📱 Professional Feel**: More like a native app
- **⚡ Improved Performance**: Faster navigation

## 🔧 **Implementation Details:**

### **Customer App Manifest:**
```json
{
  "name": "Pezela Customer - Shop & Order Online",
  "short_name": "Pezela Customer",
  "launch_handler": {
    "client_mode": ["navigate-existing", "auto"]
  },
  "handle_links": "preferred"
}
```

### **Business App Manifest:**
```json
{
  "name": "Pezela Business - Complete Business Management",
  "short_name": "Pezela Business",
  "launch_handler": {
    "client_mode": ["navigate-existing", "auto"]
  },
  "handle_links": "preferred"
}
```
