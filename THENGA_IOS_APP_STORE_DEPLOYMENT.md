# ðŸš€ Thenga iOS App Store Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy your Thenga PWA and create an iOS app for the App Store using the PWA wrapper approach.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
- Apple Developer Account ($99/year)
- Xcode installed on your Mac
- Your Thenga PWA ready for deployment
- Domain hosting (for PWA deployment)

## ðŸŽ¯ Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Deploy Your Thenga PWA

#### Option A: Deploy to Firebase Hosting (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to your PWA directory
cd /Users/macbook/Documents/MoWebProjects/Thenga_Project/Thenga/apps/pwa

# Install Firebase CLI if not already installed
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase (if not already done)
firebase init hosting

# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy
```

#### Option B: Deploy to Your Own Domain
```bash
# Run the deployment script
cd /Users/macbook/Documents/MoWebProjects/Thenga_Project/Thenga/apps/pwa
chmod +x deploy-customer-to-domain.sh
./deploy-customer-to-domain.sh
```

### Step 2: Configure Xcode Project

1. **Open Xcode Project:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/macbook/Documents/MoWebProjects/Thenga_Project/appstore_screenshots/Thenga/src
   open Thenga.xcworkspace
   ```

2. **Configure Bundle Identifier:**
   - Select "Thenga" project in Xcode

### Step 3: Configure PWA URL

The Xcode project is already configured to load:
- **URL:** `https://thenga.mozdev.co.za`
- **Allowed Origins:** `thenga.mozdev.co.za`

If you deployed to a different URL, update `Settings.swift`:
```swift
let rootUrl = URL(string: "https://your-actual-domain.com")!
let allowedOrigins: [String] = ["your-actual-domain.com"]
```
