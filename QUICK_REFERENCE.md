# 🚀 Quick Reference - Your App Locations

## 📁 **Project Structure:**

```
Pezela/
├── standalone-pwa/          # Business Web App (Port 3004)
├── apps/pwa/               # Customer Web App (Broken - missing vite)
├── PezelaAppStore/         # 🎯 EXPO MOBILE APP (This is what you want!)
└── apps/mobile-app/        # React Native App (Xcode)
```

## 🎯 **For Mobile App Development:**

### **✅ Correct Directory:**
```bash
cd /Users/macbook/Documents/MoWebProjects/Pezela_Project/Pezela/PezelaAppStore
npm start
```

### **❌ Wrong Directory:**
```bash
cd /Users/macbook/Documents/MoWebProjects/Pezela_Project/Pezela/apps/pwa
npm start  # This will fail - no start script!
```

## 📱 **Your App is Now Running:**

- **Location**: `PezelaAppStore/` directory
- **Command**: `npm start` (from the correct directory)
- **Status**: Running in background
- **Test**: Scan QR code with Expo Go app

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Install Expo Go** on your iPhone
2. **Scan the QR code** from the terminal
3. **Test your app** on your phone
4. **Deploy to App Store** via https://expo.dev

## 💡 **Why the Error Happened:**

- You were in `apps/pwa/` (Customer Web App)
- But the mobile app is in `PezelaAppStore/` (Expo App)
- Different projects have different scripts!

## ✅ **Solution:**

Always use the correct directory:
```bash
cd /Users/macbook/Documents/MoWebProjects/Pezela_Project/Pezela/PezelaAppStore
npm start
```

**Your app is now running! Check the terminal for the QR code!** 🎉
