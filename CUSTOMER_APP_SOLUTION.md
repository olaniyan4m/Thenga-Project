# Customer App Solution

## Current Issue
The customer app at https://pezela-customer-new.web.app is still redirecting to the business app.

## Possible Solutions

### Option 1: Create New Firebase Account (Recommended)
Yes, creating a separate Firebase account for the customer app would be the cleanest solution:

1. **Create new Google account** (e.g., pezela-customer@gmail.com)
2. **Create new Firebase project** with that account
3. **Deploy customer app** to the new project
4. **Get new web.app URL** (e.g., https://pezela-customer-2024.web.app)

### Option 2: Use Different Hosting Platform
- **Netlify** (free tier available)
- **Vercel** (free tier available)  
- **GitHub Pages** (free)
- **Surge.sh** (free)

### Option 3: Use Different Domain
- **Custom domain** (e.g., customer.pezela.com)
- **Different subdomain** (e.g., shop.pezela.com)
